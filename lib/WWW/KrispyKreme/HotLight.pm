  # get array ref of all the krispy kreme locations near given geo
  my $stores = $donuts->locations;

  foreach my $store (@$stores) {

      # boolean value which shows if the Hot Light is on now!
      my $is_fresh = $store->{Hotlight};

WWW::KrispyKreme::HotLight is a Perl wrapper for Krispy Kreme's location search
page.  This module will return an array ref of hash refs which contain info for
all the Krispy Kreme stores near the given geolocation.

=head1 METHODS

    my $donuts = WWW::KrispyKreme::HotLight->new(where => [34.170833,-118.25]);
